@author		Scott Fazackerley
@brief		Intercepts stdio.h defined functions for use on AVR platform.
@details	stdio.h is not fully defined within avr-gcc. As a result, functions
			for file operations are defined and not implemented or not defined.
			This means it is difficult to cross compile src that contains
			stdio.h functions. Include this header at the top of the file,
			but after stdio.h and the functions defined below will override.

			Flags:  -DIntercept

			Compiling with the -DIntercept flag will override stdio.h functions.
			Leaving the flag (and thus the functions) out will allow for
			regular use.
